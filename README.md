# getting sims to watch an anime

DeathNote
---------
- Edgiest, hard to explain, but probably the most 'sims' of the shows
- Really really good first arc, then goes downhill
- Our protagonist is an intelligent anti hero (Sasuke if competent)
- Fun to watch, kind of dark. Kind of like HoC in that all of the 'battling' that occurs is like psychological manuevering.
- 37 episodes (total - i only watched like first 15)
- comparison to other show sims watched: HoC but fast paced and no kevin spacey

Steins; Gate
------------
- Starts slow, but hits the hardest
- Very contained story
- Most SciFi of the bunch - our protagonist is a broke scientist, and the plot revolves around a microwave
- The most interesting 'directing' of the bunch in terms of 'animation' AND 'story structure'
- 24 episodes
- comparison to other show sims watched: Japanese Mr Robot basically

FMA: Brotherhood
----------------
- Shounen
- Philosophical, but in a thematic way, without being oppressive
- Racism, corruption, morality, etc.
- Story is a 'journey'
- Character driven, emotional
- Most like Naruto of the bunch (has fighting) but our protagonist is actually competent 
- Large story, told very well, introduces an entire world (like Hunter)
- 64 episodes
- comparison to other show sims watched: Naruto but good


Zeke Choice 
===========
For me, best anime of all time would go to Hunter's Chimera Ant arc, then a toss up between all of
FMA: Brotherhood, and all of Steins; Gate.
I'd say go with Steins; Gate.
